Segment 2
Description of source data:
The data used in this segment two and for the entire final project is extracted entirely from Spotify. In order to extract the data, we’ve used an Application Programming Interface (API) to connect it to our database and Imported it as a CSV file.

1) Outline reason for topic selection:
	-Spotifyï¿½is currently the worldï¿½sï¿½most valuabe music company, and for good reason. Now worth around $25 billion, the company has had a major impact on both the popularity of music streaming and the way the music industry uses the data these streaming services generate in impactful ways.
	-Streaming music platforms are using data collected by consumer interaction in an effort to hone their algorithms, improve user experiences, target audiences with ads, and make overall better-informedï¿½business decisions. Spotify currently hasï¿½over 108 million paying subscribersï¿½and another 124 million free usersï¿½meaning there are billions of streams contributing daily to these processes, whether listeners are directly aware of it or not. Read on to explore some of the most common trends in big data use by Spotify and how that data is being used to improve streaming services today.
	-A listenerï¿½s taste profile is also used in a Spotify function called ï¿½Daily Mixes.ï¿½ These playlists are separated by the genres of music the user typically gravitate toward and are comprised of songs that:
The user has saved or added to playlists.
Are written by the same artists the user has in their current playlists.
Are from new artists or albums the user does not yet know.

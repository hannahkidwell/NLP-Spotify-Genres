1) Outline reason for topic selection:
	-Spotify is currently the world’s most valuabe music company, and for good reason. Now worth around $25 billion, the company has had a major impact on both the popularity of music streaming and the way the music industry uses the data these streaming services generate in impactful ways.
	-Streaming music platforms are using data collected by consumer interaction in an effort to hone their algorithms, improve user experiences, target audiences with ads, and make overall better-informed business decisions. Spotify currently has over 108 million paying subscribers—and another 124 million free users—meaning there are billions of streams contributing daily to these processes, whether listeners are directly aware of it or not. Read on to explore some of the most common trends in big data use by Spotify and how that data is being used to improve streaming services today.
	-A listener’s taste profile is also used in a Spotify function called “Daily Mixes.” These playlists are separated by the genres of music the user typically gravitate toward and are comprised of songs that:
The user has saved or added to playlists.
Are written by the same artists the user has in their current playlists.
Are from new artists or albums the user does not yet know.

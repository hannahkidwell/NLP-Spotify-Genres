ten years The type of abuse described was not limited to the usual beating but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and planned torture The evidence presented by some individuals convinced juries and appellate courts that personnel assigned to Area 2 engaged in methodical abuse 20 The number of incidents in which an Area 2 command member is identified as an accused can lead to only one conclusion Particular command members were aware of the systematic abuse and participated in it either by actively participating in same or failing to take any action to bring it to an end This conclusion is also supported by the number of incidents in which Area 2 offices are named as the location of the abuse OPS Special Project Conclusion Reports and Findings and Cover Letter Shines to Martin dated November 2 1990 Goldston Report  93 In her forwarding memo of November 2 1990 OPS Director Shines while approving the conclusions of Goldston and Sanders further informed Superintendent Martin that they both did a masterful job of marshaling the facts in this intensive and extensive project and their conclusions are compelling 11/2/90 Cover Memo Shines to Martin with OPS Special Project Conclusion Reports and Findings enclosed  94 On or about November 2 1990 OPS Director Gayle Shines approved as compelling and forwarded to Superintendent Martin the 66 page report and conclusions of OPS investigator Francine Sanders which found that based on the overwhelming body of evidence which supports the allegations that administrative charges of excessive force should be sustained against Jon Burge and John Yucaitis including that they repeatedly administered electrical stimulation to Mr  Wilsons body in order to create pain and that Burge held Mr Wilson while handcuffed against a hot radiator causing burns to Mr Wilsons face chest and thigh Chicago Police Office of Professional Standards OPS Special Investigative Report and Findings October 26 1990 Sanders Report pp62 66  95 Martin acknowledged the  serious nature of Goldstons conclusions Martin memo to Shines 11/18/90  96 At no time from receiving the Goldston Report in November of 1990 until he left 21 office in April of 1992 did Martin OPS Director Shines or any other City policymaking official take any steps to further investigate the allegations made by the some fifty victims listed in the Goldston report  97 Instead Martin after waiting three months wrote Shines seeking further clarification concerning the Goldston and Sanders Reports Memo Martin to Shines 2/6/91  98 Despite all of the torture evidence contained in the Goldston and Sanders Reports in the Fact Sheet and that was previously presented to Martin and the City Council the City and Martin did not seek the prosecution of Burge and his confederates in the Wilson case for a continuing conspiracy on the basis of the numerous other torture cases listed in the Goldston report or to prosecute Burge for the numerous other cases which were documented in the evidence presented including the Patterson and Madison Hobley cases  99 In her April 30 1991 memorandum to Martin Shines supplied the clarifications sought by Martin and informed him that the OPS findings reflect the unprecedented comprehensiveness of this investigation Shines memo 4/30/91  100 With her April 30 1991 memorandum to Superintendent Martin OPS Director Shines included investigator Goldstons clarification memo in which Goldston set forth that his investigation established that Area 2 detectives and supervisors Jon Burge John Byrne Peter Dignan Charles Grunhard John Yucaitis Thomas McKenna and Patrick OHara were players whose names repeatedly appeared as connected to allegations of abuse Goldston Memo of 4/30/91 attached to Shines Memo to Martin of the same date  101 After waiting an additional seven months in November of 1991 Superintendent Leroy Martin approved the findings set forth in the Chicago Police Office of Professional 22 Standards OPS Special Investigative Report and Findings dated October 26 1990 Sanders Report Burge and Yucaitis were administratively charged by the CPD for abusing Andrew Wilson in the manner found in the Report and separation proceedings were initiated before the Chicago Police Board Cr 123543 reopened  102 However after secret communications with Corporation Counsel Kelly Welch which the City still refuses to produce Martin refused to accept or adopt the Goldston findings open any additional criminal or administrative investigations into the numerous allegations of Area 2 torture to commission additional investigation into the alleged systemic pattern and practice of torture or to discipline or seek criminal charges against any of the named officers but rather contacted the Police Foundation in order to have them evaluate the methodology used by Goldston in arriving at his findings Martin Letter to Williams 11/8/91 City Privilege Log  103 During this time period community groups including Citizens Alert by letters and in face to face meetings were demanding that Martin release the results of the OPS investigation into torture at Area 2 Powers Letter to Martin 8/14/91  104 Instead Martin through his lawyers at the Corporation Counsels Office fought production and public release of the Goldston Report and its findings See generally proceedings in Fallon v Dillon 90 C 6722  105 In November of 1991 after Defendant Martin and Corporation Counsel Kelly Welsh had initiated proceedings before the Police Board to fire Burge Yucaitis and OHara for

Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge John Yucaitis and Patrick OHara Cases # 1856 58 specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers on behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago made the following judicial admission concerning the testimony of seven additional victims of torture tactics at Area II headquarters The testimony regarding similar acts sets forth detailed accounts of tortuous treatment that are almost identical to the torture suffered by Andrew Wilson The testimony reveals an astounding pattern or plan on the part of respondents  to torture certain suspects often with substantial criminal records into confessing to crimes or to condone such activity 24 Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct p 1  110 In their Memorandum In Opposition specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers on behalf of Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago identified the seven additional victims of torture tactics at Area II headquarters as Melvin Jones Anthony Holmes George Powell Donald White Shadeed Mumin Leroy Orange and Lawrence Poree Id pp 7  14 111 In their Memorandum In Opposition specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers on behalf of Martin and the City made the following judicial admission       that the similar acts testimony of Melvin Jones Anthony Holmes George Powell Donald White Shadeed Mumin Leroy Orange and Lawrence Poree s highly probative of the modus operandi used or condoned in the torturing of suspects to elicit statements Respondents  methods of torture through electric shock bagging and holding a gun to a suspects head are more that sufficiently unique to establish a modus operandi for 404 b purposes In addition the testimony establishes a pattern of and plan to torture these suspects in these similar ways to elicit confessions to violent crimes Id p 17 112 In their Memorandum In Opposition specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers on behalf of Martin and the City judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of Melvin Jones Anthony Holmes George Powell Donald White Shadeed Mumin Leroy Orange and Lawrence Poree clearly establishes respondents  motive and intent in torturing or condoning the torture of Wilson Respondents generally engaged in these similar practices in order to coerce a confession to a serious crime Id p 22 25 113 In their Memorandum In Opposition specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers on behalf of Martin and the City judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of Melvin Jones Anthony Holmes George Powell Donald White Shadeed Mumin Leroy Orange and Lawrence Poree shows the physical existence of one or more electric shock devices at Area II prior to and subsequent to Wilsons arrest and Burges possession of and familiarity with the use of the devices It is also admissible to show knowledge of that technique and of the bagging technique about which respondents deny knowing and the technique of putting a gun to the head of a victim Id p 24 114 In their Memorandum In Opposition specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers on behalf of Martin and the City made the following judicial admission There is no question that the similarities between  Wilsons testimony and the similar victims testimony is more than sufficient to meet the 404 b standard Burge was the main perpetrator of the torture in almost all of the cases and when he was not the principal he was still involved In the case of all but one of the victims the victim was picked up and taken to Area II where he was then interrogated regarding his knowledge or involvement in a serious offense Although Donald White was taken instead to Area I he was taken there and interrogated by Area II detectives All of the victims were black and generally had significant criminal histories Also similar was the way in which several victims were threatened with consequences if they refused to make a statement After an initial refusal the punishment would begin and then would become stronger and more painful as the refusals to speak persisted The most striking similarities however are found in the methods of torture used on the suspects Wilson was electro shocked by Yucaitis using the black box and by Burge who used the black box and a curling iron looking device was bagged and beaten and was threatened with a gun placed in his mouth Jones Holmes Poree Powell and Orange were similarly electro shocked by Burge Holmes Powell White and Mumin were all bagged and beaten to the point where they lost or almost lost consciousness Burge pointed a cocked gun at Joness head hit Poree in the head with a pistol and placed a revolver containing one bullet at Mumins head and snapped it three times slowly White had a gun placed in his mouth Additionally each of the victims was slapped around and punched Burges statements to the victims were also very similar Burge told both Jones and Mumin that nobody would ever believe their word against his As he did in relation to Wilson he referred to the absence of marks on Mumins body He said fun time as 26 he approached Wilson and Poree with the black box and laughed when he bagged Mumin He told Wilson he would fry his black ass and Jones he would blow his black head off As the case law cited above aptly demonstrates these actions or the condoning of these actions are overwhelming in their similarity Id pp 25 26 115 In their Memorandum In Opposition specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers on behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago made the following judicial admission Given the similarities between the serious offenses charged and the offenses to which the similar victims will testify there is no question that the offenses are close enough in time to be relevant to this case Tak the offenses in sequence they reveal a pattern of almost identical acts of torture directed towards persons suspected of violent crimes While the sequence spans twelve years each offense is close enough to the next to connect it to the relevant pattern of behavior Moreover Melvin Jones and Donald Whites testimony will demonstrate that they were tortured just days before Andrew Wilson was tortured Id p 28 116 In their Memorandum In Opposition specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers on behalf of Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago judicially admitted Indeed as the testimony of the similar victims shows respondents  counted on the fact that their testimony would be believed over that of a convict when they persisted in their pattern of torture Id p 28 117 In a document filed in the case of Wilson v City of Chicago Jon Burge Patrick OHara and John Yucaitis 86 C 2360 entitled City of Chicagos Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Andrew Wilsons Motion for Summary Judgment the City through its lawyers made the following judicial admission Plaintiff Andrew Wilson has testified that he was beaten kicked punched burned by being harnessed to a radiator and repeatedly electro shocked on his hands face ears and 27 between his legs by defendant police officers Plaintiff now seeks summary judgment that this outrageous conduct unsanctioned and condemned by the City and for which defendant officers were fired and/or disciplined was within the defendants scope of employment City Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Wilsons Motion for Summary Judgment p 1 118 In a document filed in the case of Wilson v City of Chicago 86 C 2360 entitled City of Chicagos Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Andrew Wilsons Motion for Summary Judgment the City through its lawyers made the following judicial admission The instrumentalities by which defendants tortured plaintiff also illustrate that defendant officers were not in the scope of their employment Plaintiff has failed to furnish any evidence to suggest that the instruments used by the officers to shock him      the black box device and the modified curling iron     were furnished by the City Id p 17 119 In its Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Andrew Wilsons Motion for Summary Judgment the City through its lawyers made the judicial admission that Burge cruelly torture Andrew Wilson and denie him necessary medical assistance Id p 19 120 In this Memorandum the City through its lawyers made the following admission concerning it change of position from defending Burge for his alleged torture of Andrew Wilson to asserting that said torture was so outrageous as to be outside the scope of Burges employment The change in the Citys position was the result of inquiries undertaken by the City in good faith and in the public interest Id p 12 121 On July 30 1992 almost two years after Superintendent Martin had first received the Goldston findings the Police Foundation submitted its report to Superintendent of Police Matt Rodriguez After noting that because hangings shockings baggings beatings chokings and beatings were alleged to occur many in the Area 2 Headquarters itself a thorough and rigorous investigation seemed required and that it passed no judgment as to whether the torture alleged had in fact took place the Report criticized Goldstons methodology Police Foundation 28 Report An Analysis of the Methods Employed in the Preparation of the Goldston Report 7/30/92 122 The Police Foundation recommended inter alia that the Chicago Police Department investigate or re investigate cases of serious misconduct listed in the Goldston Report create a database concerning these investigations rigorously and uniformly investigate them and create a monitoring system to identify patterns of serious police misconduct Id 123 Almost three years after first receiving the

Jon Burge and many officers working under him regularly engaged in the physical abuse 33 and torture of prisoners to extract confessions Both internal police accounts and numerous lawsuits and appeals brought by suspects alleging such abuse substantiate that those beatings and other means of torture occurred as an established practice not just on an isolated basis 150 At the May 13 2003 oral

discipline increases their overtime leads to an enormous paper storm and has institutionalized lying Proposed Revamping of Office of Professional Standards October 19 1987 p 2 359  360 In Jones v City of Chicago 856 F 2d 985 7th Cir 1987 the Seventh Circuit 76 Court of Appeals affirmed a jury verdict against Area 2 Violent Crimes detectives supervisors and commanding officers including detectives James Houtsma Dennis McGuire John McCabe and Raymond McNally Sgt Alvin Palmer Lt Griffith and Commander Milton Deas for conspiracy to railroad 18 year old George Jones for a 1981 murder stating We cannot say that the jury acted unreasonably in finding that all of the individual defendants were voluntary participants in a common venture to railroad George Jones Jones v City of Chicago 856 F 2d at 992 361 In Jones v City of Chicago the Seventh Circuit affirmed a jury verdict against the City of Chicago for maintaining a street filescustom or policy which led to the railroading of 18 year old George Jones for a 1981 murder stating The custom in question is the maintenance of the street files police files withheld from the states attorney and therefore unavailable as a source of exculpatory information that might induce him not to prosecute or failing that would at least be available to defense counsel under Brady v Maryland 373 US 83 10 L Ed 2d 215 83 S Ct 1194 1963 As we noted recently information undermining the credibility of a government witness is within the scope of Bradys rule See United States v Herrera Medina 853 F2d 564 slip op at 5 7th Cir 1988 Although the lawfulness of the street files practice has never been adjudicated the City which has abandoned the practice does not challenge the jurys implicit finding that it denied criminal defendants due process of law Brady v Maryland does not require the police to keep written records of all their investigatory activities but attempts to circumvent the rule of that case by retaining records in clandestine files deliberately concealed from prosecutors and defense counsel cannot be tolerated The City sensibly does not attempt to defend such behavior in this court There is little doubt that the clandestine character of the street files played a role in Joness misfortunes Cf Harris v City of Pagedale 821 F2d 499 507 8th Cir 1987 If the states attorney had had  access to them he would have discovered memos by Kelly and especially by Laverty that would have given any prosecutor pause Alternatively defense 77 counsel would have obtained them prior to trial and the trial would have ended even sooner than it did The only question is whether this custom was a custom of the City of Chicago As the custom was department wide and of long standing the jury was entitled to conclude that it had been consciously approved at the highest policy making level for decisions involving the police department    the standard suggested by the recent plurality opinion in City of St Louis v Praprotnik 485 US

Holmes CR# 126802 Philip Adkins CR# 142201 Donald White CR# 169867 Lavert Jones CR# 200390 Stanley Ware CR# 202019 112 Michael Johnson CR# 125071 and wrote that you are hereby instructed to classify all of the allegations in the above referenced complaint register files as not sustained August 31 1998 memo from Thomas Needham General Counsel to the Superintendent to Leonard Benefico Office of Professional Standards 585 As a basis for this unprecedented order Needham cited the age of the cases and the purported lack of new evidence when in fact a wealth of new evidence had been developed by the OPS investigators in almost all of the cases Id CR files of listed cases Testimony of OPS investigators at People v Cannon Hearing 586 Superintendent Hillard after talking to Neeedham about his decision ratified his actions in not sustaining these cases stating under oath that I support Tom Needham 100 percent when it comes down to representing me in this department in hard cases like that Hillard Dep Santiago v Marquez 5/3/99 pp 32 33 35 36 587 In a letter dated August 2 1999 from Citizens Alert addressed to Superintendent Terry Hillard OPS Director Callie Baird and Police Board President Demitrius Carney the signators wrote We write as a group of public officials citizens and organizations concerned with police violence and discipline to urge you to immediately reopen and review several Office of Professional Standards OPS investigations into police torture and to open investigations in numerous other torture cases where no OPS investigations have been conducted We further urge you to commission an independent investigation into the obvious violations of police regulations and procedure and legal process by certain OPS and police officials during the torture investigations which were conducted by the OPS August 2 1999 Letter from Citizens Alert Mary Powers et al to Hillard Carney and Baird 588 In the August 2 1999 letter the signators further wrote 113 Recent news articles and publicly released documents and depositions reveal that the OPS reopened nine torture investigations in 1992 and 1993 as a result of prior OPS findings that physical abuse of African American suspects at Area 2 from 1973 to 1986 included psychological techniques and planned torture was systematic and methodical and that Area 2 command members particularly Jon Burge were aware of the systematic abuse and perpetuated it either by actively participating in same or failing to take any action to bring it to an end Goldston Report pp 2 3 The now public evidence further reveals that OPS investigators Tillman Lawrence and Cosey conducted thorough investigations in each of these cases discovered new evidence not available during the initial investigations and sustained findings in six of the cases The sustained findings included findings that victims were electric shocked suffocated with a plastic bag suspended in air by their handcuffs beaten and stomped and racially abused The evidence further shows that these sustained findings were entered against several police officers who were and are still Chicago police officers in good standing most notably Lieutenant Peter Dignan who had allegations of torture and abuse sustained against him in five of the six cases The evidence further reveals that these findings and the investigative files were tendered to OPS Director Gayle Shines in 1994 for her review and that she overturned the findings in four of the cases in late 1994 and early 1995 at the same time that Peter Dignan was nominated by the Mayor and the Department for merit promotion to Lieutenant Ms Shines has admitted that in the approximately 2500 sustained cases which she reviewed during her eight year career as Director she overturned a total of 10 cases including these four against Dignan The evidence further shows that in the other two cases Darrell Cannon and Stanley Howard Ms Shines never completed her review of the sustained findings of torture but rather kept these files in her office for four years together with the other seven files Cannon who was on trial in a murder case and Howard who is on death row sought these files by subpoena but Shines and the Department failed to produce these files which contained highly exculpatory evidence Furthermore after Ms Shines left the OPS in 1998 counsel to the Superintendent Thomas Needham obtained the nine torture files from the OPS and without consultation with the Superintendent summarily reversed the sustained findings and closed the cases Needham who as a longtime assistant states attorney was closely connected to the prosecution of several torture victims including Cannon admitted that his summary reversals of the torture findings were not based on the merits of the cases but rather on the fact that the files had languished in Shines office for so long a period of time The Superintendent never reviewed these cases on the merits as he is required by police procedure to do and he only learned of his counsels unjustifiable actions by reading about them in a February 1999 Chicago Tribune article Additionally the public evidence reveals that the OPS failed to investigate numerous additional documented cases of police torture against African American suspects In the case of Melvin Jones Mary Powers of Citizens Alert specifically requested by a letter dated July 26 1989 that the OPS open an investigation into the recently revealed allegations that Jones was electric shocked at by Jon Burge and several other Area 2 detectives who remain on the force to this day Contrary to police and OPS procedure no investigation was ever opened despite the fact that the City has subsequently admitted in 114 official court papers that Jones was in fact tortured Similarly in the Shadeed Mumin case an investigation was opened and OPS investigators developed compelling new evidence that he was tortured by Burge and an unidentified detective Just as the OPS investigator was about to identify this officer the OPS discontinued the investigation supposedly because the investigation had not been assigned a complaint register number In numerous other cases including Aaron Patterson and nine other men who are presently on death row as a result of confessions which they allege were tortured from them the OPS has failed to conduct any investigation whatsoever into these most serious allegations Id 589 In the August 2 1999 letter the signators made the following demands 1 Given Ms Shines clear misconduct lack of objectivity and failure to complete her review of the Cannon and Howard sustained findings that new OPS Director Callie Baird conduct an independent review on the merits of the six sustained torture cases 2 If Ms Baird concurs with one or more of the sustained findings that the Superintendent fully and fairly review those findings on the merits as he is required by police procedure to do 3 That counsel Thomas Needham be disqualified from any role in reviewing or otherwise participating in any torture investigations 4 That Peter Dignan and any other active officers against whom torture findings were entered by OPS investigators be suspended pending complete review 5 That the department and its OPS open an investigation into the allegations that Melvin Jones was electric shocked by Jon Burge and other still active detectives and consider in making its findings that the City has admitted that Jones was in fact tortured 6 That the Department and its OPS reopen and complete the Shadeed Mumin investigation 7 That the Department and its OPS open investigations into the other numerous documented cases of police torture as listed in the Appendix attached hereto including those allegations made by men on death row 8 That the Department commission an independent investigation into the serious violations of departmental rules and court process by high ranking police and OPS officials including Thomas Needham and Gayle Shines 9 That the Department and the OPS Director meet with representatives from the undersigned groups and discuss these proposals and to periodically report on the progress of these investigations 10That these investigations and findings be subject to public scrutiny Id 115 590 In the August 2 1999 from Citizens Alert the signators set forth the following cases for Director Bairds Review Darrell Cannon CR#134723 Stanley Howard CR# 142017 Gregory Banks CR# 188617 David Bates CR# 188617 Lee Holmes CR# 126802 Philip Adkins CR# 142201 Thomas Craft CR# 200390 Id 591 In the August 2 1999 letter the signators listed the following cases to be Opened8 by OPS Melvin Jones TyShaun Ross Shadeed Mumin Derrick King Aaron Patterson Michael Coleman Leonard Hinton Sylvester Green Leroy Orange Paul Mike Alonzo Smith Walter Johnson Leonard Hinton Roy Brown Leroy Orange Eric Smith Jerry Mahaffey Franklin Burchette Reginald Mahaffey Vincent Wade James Cody Willie Porch Lenard Kidd Raymond Golden Lonza Holmes Tony Thompson Michael Tillman Timothy Thompson Stephen Bell Andrew Maxwell Madison Hobley Ronald Kitchen Id 592 Superintendent Hillard subsequently met with representatives from the signators of the August 2 1999 Citizens Alert letter 593 Other than Hillards meeting with representatives from the signators of the August 2 1999 Citizens Alert letter no action was taken on any of the demands made in the letter 116 594 In an e mail dated 1/10/02 Corporation Counsel Mara S Georges wrote to her assistant Sheila OGrady would like us to explore bringing an action against Burge Will you please think about it and give us your thoughts New documents Report that City Considered Suing Burge City continues Paying For Fired Commanders Legal Defense NBC 5com 4/29/04 595 On January 1 2002 Sheila OGrady was Mayor Daleys Chief of Staff Id 596 In response Jeffrey Given Georges assistant wrote that suing Burge would seem to undercut our ability to defend  suit by challenging the underlying facts    City Considered Suing Burge Officials Weighed Their Options to Fight Growing Uproar over Torture Allegations Against the Fired Police Commander Chicago Tribune 4/29/04 597 Mindful that the torture allegations were gaining new momentum Given and Georges also considered mounting a public relations campaign to counter continuing negative publicity about Burge and the Citys role in the torture scandal Id 598 Given and Georges recognized that the campaign would not be easy for a wide variety of reasons including that some of Burges men were still on the police force the department had been embarrassed by Needhams unilateral shelving of the OPS torture investigations despite the investigators sustained findings and that the Tribunes then recent series on the continuing CPD practice of obtaining false confessions had again focused attention on the issue and Given further stated but query how well do in the court of public opinion after a long public expensive and embarrassing discovery process NBC5com Chicago Tribune 599 Instead of suing Burge or otherwise distancing the City from him the City decided 117 to invest unlimited public funds in representing Burge and at least thirty five other Area 2 detectives accused of torture and abuse in the four torture cases and to fight production and public disclosure of additional documents that would further expose the Citys central role in the torture scandal in civil and criminal cases and with the Special Prosecutor Id 600 On August 27 2004 in his sworn testimony before the Prisoner Review Board former Area 2 Commander and Superintendent Leroy Martin falsely denied that he did not have contemporaneous knowledge of the allegations of torture and abuse against Jon Burge and other Area 2 detectives while he was Commander Tr of 8/27/04 Parole Revocation Hearing of Darrell Cannon 601 In her concurring opinion in Hinton v Uchtman sub nomF 3d  7th Cir 2005 Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Diane Wood found he claim Hinton has made regarding his confession illustrates dramatically the high price our system of criminal justice pays when police abuse runs rampant a cloud hangs over everything that the bad actors touched     mountain of evidence indicates that torture was an ordinary occurrence at the Area Two station of the Chicago Police Department during the exact time period pertinent to Hintons case Eventually as this sorry tale came to light the Office of Professional Standards Investigation of the Police Department looked into the allegations and it issued a report that concluded that police torture under the command of Lt Jon Burge  the officer in charge of Hintons case  had been a regular part of the system for more than ten years And in language reminiscent of the news reports of 2004 concerning the notorious Abu Ghraib facility in Iraq the report said that he type of abuse described was not limited to the usual beating but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and planned torture The report detailed specific cases such as the case of Andrew Wilson who was taken to Area Two on February 14 1982 There a group led by Burge beat Wilson stuffed a bag over his head handcuffed him to a radiator and repeatedly administered electric shocks to his ears nose and genitals See People v Wilson 506 NE2d 571 Ill 1987 Burge eventually lost his job with the police though not until 1992 See In the Matter of the Charges Filed Against Jon Burge No 91 1856 Chicago Police Board February 11 1993 To this day Burge has not been prosecuted for any of these actions though it appears that he at least thinks that he may still be at some risk of prosecution See for example 118 Cop brutality probe must be thorough fair Chi Sun Times May 16 2002 editorial Hal Dardick Burge repeatedly takes 5th Former police commander stays mum on torture questions Chi Tribune Sept 2 2004 noting allegations that Burge or people reporting to him had tortured 108 Black and Latino suspects between August 1972 and September 1991    Behavior like that attributed to Burge imposes a huge cost on society it creates distrust of the police generally despite the fact that most police officers would abhor such tactics and it creates a cloud over even the valid convictions in which the problem officer played a role Indeed the alleged conduct is so extreme that if proven it would fall within the prohibitions established by the United Nations Convention Against Torture CAT which defines torture as any act by which severe pain or suffering whether physical or mental is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession    thereby violating the fundamental human rights principles that the United States is committed to uphold   ,8
